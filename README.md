### Notes

#### Common

- `Modules` is elixir are collections of methods.

- Elixir is a functional language.

- Code => Elixir => Erlang => BEAM

#### Enter the interactive shell

```
  iex -S mix
```

#### Run a module/file

```
 Cards.create_deck()
```

#### Install all the dependencies

```
mix deps.get
```

#### Creating docs

- install :ex_doc
- @moduledoc """
  Documentation Content
  """
- run `mix docs`
- index.html file is created in doc folder
- for writing docs for single methods we use @doc """ method content """ 

#### ENUM Module

`enumerable` is like a list of records.
All the methods to handle the enumerable are in the ENUM module

```
Enum.shuffle(enum), Enum.member?(enum,element)
```

#### List Module

`list.flatten` sumsup all the list into a single list

#### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is used for variable assignment.

#### Pipe operator

#### Testing in elixir

Testing can be two types in elixir,

- Writing @doc """ testing_expressions """
- Writing doctest cases in test folder
  ```
   test "create_deck makes 20 cards" do
  deck_length = length(Cards.create_deck())
  assert deck_length == 20
  end
  ```

#### Map in elixir

- Map in elixir is similar to objects in JS or hashes in ruby
- Map is collection of key, value pair


#### Datatypes in Elixir


=================================================================

#### IO/h/i Module

- IO module performs common input/output functions.
- For help on the IO module `h(IO)` use the help module in `IEx`.
- `IO.puts "Hello World"` it writes a string to the console.
- ``` 
iex> i 123
Term
  123
Data type
  Integer
Reference modules
  Integer
Implemented protocols
  IEx.Info, Inspect, List.Chars, String.Chars
```

> Elixir is great for writing highly parallel, reliable applications.
But to be a great language for parallel programming, a language first has to be great
for conventional, sequential programming. In this part of the book weâ€™ll cover how to
write Elixir code, and explore the idioms and conventions that make Elixir so powerful.
